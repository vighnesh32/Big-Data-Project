# Big-Data-Project
File Name and Decription :

project.ipynb : This file is divided in to five sections which contains the code for preprocessing, parallelising the data preprocessing in Spark using Google Cloud Dataproc, parallelising the measuring of different configurations using Spark for first three sections respectively. For further sections the preprocessed data in Tensorflow/Keras is used and different parallelisation approaches for multiple GPUs are tested.


Sequence of running the codes :

Start by opening and running each section individually of the files mlp_hog.ipynb, mlp_swift.ipynb, svm_hog.ipynb, svm_sift.ipynb and CNN.ipynb.
Now open and run test_functions.ipynb.
